Plugin Name: LionScripts: IP Blocker Lite
Plugin URI: http://www.lionscripts.com/product/wordpress-ip-address-blocker-pro/
Description: LionScripts' IP Blocker for WordPress allows you to stop the Spam Visitors and malicious IP Addresses. You can block IP addresses by using the manual method or the Bulk IPs Upload method. By blocking the Unwanted or Spam IP Addresses, you can save your site's Bandwidth and hence the cost significantly. The blocked IPs won't be able to scrap the precious content from your WordPress Site. You can choose to either display the blocked message or an empty page to the blocked users. To do so, you can just add the IP Address to the blocking list and anytime you can delete that IP from the blocking list if you know that it's not performing malicious activities.
